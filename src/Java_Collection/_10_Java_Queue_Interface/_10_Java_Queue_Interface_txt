✍ Java Queue Interface :-
--------------------------
► The interface Queue is available in the java.util package and does extend the Collection interface. 
  It is used to keep the elements that are processed in the First In First Out (FIFO) manner. 
  It is an ordered list of objects, where insertion of elements occurs at the end of the list, 
  and removal of elements occur at the beginning of the list.

► Being an interface, the queue requires, for the declaration, a concrete class, 
  and the most common classes are the LinkedList and PriorityQueue in Java. 
  Implementations done by these classes are not thread safe. 
  If it is required to have a thread safe implementation, PriorityBlockingQueue is an available option.
	
-> Queue Interface Declaration : 
-----------------------------------
			public interface Queue<E> extends Collection<E>

⦿	Features of a Queue :-
--------------------------
	◦  As discussed earlier, FIFO concept is used for insertion and deletion of elements from a queue.
	◦  The Java Queue provides support for all of the methods of the Collection interface including deletion, insertion, etc.
	◦  PriorityQueue, ArrayBlockingQueue and LinkedList are the implementations that are used most frequently.
	◦  The NullPointerException is raised, if any null operation is done on the BlockingQueues.
	◦  Those Queues that are present in the util package are known as Unbounded Queues.
	◦  Those Queues that are present in the util.concurrent package are known as bounded Queues.
	◦  All Queues barring the Deques facilitates removal and insertion at the head and tail of the queue; respectively. 
	   In fact, deques support element insertion and removal at both ends.
