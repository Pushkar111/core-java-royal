✍ Java Member Inner class
--------------------------
► A non-static class that is created inside a class but outside a method is called *member inner class*.
► It is also known as a regular inner class. 
► It can be declared with access modifiers like public, default, private, and protected.

⦿	Syntax:
-----------
	class Outer
	{  
		 //code  
		 class Inner
		 {  
		  //code  
		  // method
		 }  
	}  



⦿	Java Member Inner Class Example 1
-------------------------------------
► In this example, we are creating a msg() method in the member inner class that is accessing the private data member of the outer class.

	TestMemberOuter1.java
	---------------------
		public class TestMemberOuter1 {
			private int data = 100;
		
			class inner {
				void disp() {
					System.out.println("Data: " + data);
				}
			}
		
			public static void main(String[] args) {
				TestMemberOuter1 objOuter = new TestMemberOuter1();
		
				TestMemberOuter1.inner objInner = objOuter.new inner();
		
				objInner.disp();
			}
		}
