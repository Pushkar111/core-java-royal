Purpose -> 100 % utilization of Hardware and productivity Increase 

Thread -> Subprocesses -> [Small Unit of thread]

=> Thread :- A thread is a lightweight subprocess, the smallest unit of processing. 
----------	 It is a separate path of execution.
	-> Two ways to make Threads in java
		1) By extending Thread class
		2) By implementing Runnable interface
		
=> if JVM provides separate callStack then Thread make 
   else Thread will not make 
   
=> This Thread made by start() method
=> Behavior -> Simantinously

		Runnable(I)  -- void run();

		Thread(C)  --  void run(){}

		MyClass(C) --- job_define -- void run()
