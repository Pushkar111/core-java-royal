	◦  Java TreeSet class contains unique elements only like HashSet.
	◦  Java TreeSet class access and retrieval times are quite fast.
	◦  Java TreeSet class doesn't allow null elements.
	◦  Java TreeSet class is non-synchronized.
	◦  Java TreeSet class maintains ascending order.
	◦  The TreeSet can only allow those generic types that are comparable.
